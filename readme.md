# Pandas 

1. A library built on the top of Python programming language.
2. It is a robust toolkit for nalyzing, filtering, manipulating, aggregating, merging, pivoting, and cleaning data
3. It is like **Excel for Python**

### Prerequisites
1. Basic Knowledge of spreadsheet software.
2. Basic Python
3. Basic Numpy

### Installation

1. Via Conda(Anaconda Distribution)
```buildoutcfg
conda install pandas
```
2. Via PyPi
```buildoutcfg
pip install pandas
```

### What Problem Does Pandas Solve

Python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less so for data analysis and modeling. pandas helps fill this gap, enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in Python without having to switch to a more domain specific language like R.

Combined with the excellent IPython toolkit and other libraries, the environment for doing data analysis in Python excels in performance, productivity, and the ability to collaborate.

pandas does not implement significant modeling functionality outside of linear and panel regression; for this, look to statsmodels and scikit-learn. More work is still needed to make Python a first class statistical modeling environment, but we are well on our way toward that goal.
